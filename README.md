The gaming room
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
A game called "Draw it or Lose it" was the software used by the client, The Gaming Room. It was necessary to develop a web-based game application that could be scaled and used with a variety of operating systems.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I done a good job of describing the requirements of the application in this document. I was able to make clear recommendations regarding the optimal method for creating the application and the ideal operating system for the game.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The UML and domain model were really useful to me. I was able to build up the code and produce a usable program that complied with the client's requirements by using the UML.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the process of explaining which the operating sytstems and adding prices of how much each would cost and which would be the best to start out with.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I play a lot of games on my pc and used that to implement the software design and explained which parts are the most important such as not having lag or too many people on one server.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? I used my own approach such as what i look for in a game or what i dont want to happen while im playing a certain game. The strategies i would use in the future are looking at other peoples ideas and approaches for building a game and see how they would want to see a game run.
